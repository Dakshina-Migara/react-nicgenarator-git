This is a React application that allows users to input their National Identity Card (NIC) number and automatically displays their birthday and gender. It supports both the old 10-digit NIC format and the new 12-digit format. The app uses Material-UI (MUI) components to create a responsive, card-based interface with a clean and user-friendly design. Users can enter their NIC number in a text field, click the submit button, and instantly see the extracted NIC number, birthday, and gender displayed below. The project demonstrates the use of React functional components, hooks, and MUI styling for building interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.
